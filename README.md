 # GalaxyXE
GalaxyXE is a OpenGL and C++ game engine designed for 3D graphics.
This engine is currently bound to another parallel project, a game.
Further updates are scheduled as the game itself is not playable. However the basic graphics interface is programmable and executable. Remember, this build is just in a beta state as I am learning somethings about game development myself.
